Hi Mark,
 
I consulted with Sam to get some more info for you, here's his response:
 
We leave the color coding description intentionally simple and fuzzy to help new users avoid over thinking color coding.


This post is for the more technical users, skip it if you are just trying to casually makes some shapes and get cutting.

 

You can test this yourself by making a range of colored squares and tracking how they are interpreted by Origin.

 

Here are some high level rules using safe round numbers:


each RGB value exists ranges from 0 - 255

 

To safely interpret as white:

preferably all colors are 255,
but all values greater than 190 will work
to safely interpret as black:

preferably all values are 0
but all values being less than 50 is safe
To safely interpret as grey:

Keep the spread of values less than 50
and keep all values within 65 - 180 to prevent them being interpreted as black or white
To safely interpret as blue:

blue needs to be a value 60 more than the other colors
 

The actual value without the safety buffer where the transition occurs are a little more specific:


127, 127, 181 will interpret as a blue guide. ( spread = 54 )
127, 127, 180 will interpret as a grey pocket. ( spread = 53 )

 

all values of 61 or less will interpret as black
all values of 189 or more will will interpret white

 
Let me know if you have any further questions!
 
Best,
Ted
